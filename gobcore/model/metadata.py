"""GOB metadata

Definition of the attributes that are automatically added to each GOB entity.

The auto-included attributes have the purpose of
    registering the last application of a specific event, e.g. date_confirmed
    registering the source of the data; source and source_id
    provide for a internal id and universal id reference; gobid and id
